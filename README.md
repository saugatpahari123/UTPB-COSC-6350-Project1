# UTPB-COSC-6350-Project1
This repo contains the assignment for Project 1 of the graduate Wireless Security class.

The goal of Project 1 is to perform some Wardriving, to help understand the current landscape of wireless access points in the local area and get a sense for how poor the security landscape still is.

In your groups, pick a unique 1-mile by 1-mile square of Odessa or Midland Texas.  Your goal is to use any of the available wardriving apps available on the Android store to find and map as many 802.11 access points as you can find in that square mile.

This takes about 4 hours of driving around at about 15-20 mph, with multiple phones all running your choice of mapping application.  Once you have gathered as much data as possible (SSIDs, security settings, and GPS coordinates), your deliverable for the project is a map of the region with each AP marked with a pip at its GPS coords and organized by security (Open, WEP, WPA1, WPA2, or WPA3).

Carefully select your wardriving app so that you can get a nice, easy-to-use spreadsheet of the APs and related stats that you find.  This will make it considerably easier when the time comes for you to plug your data into the Google Maps API and create a map.

The deliverables for this project are:
1) A spreadsheet containing the data you captured, organized in a readable manner.
2) A map and the code used to generate the map.
3) Your group will be asked to present your findings in a brief (10-15 minute) presentation in class.
